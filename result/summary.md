# Project Report on skin lesions: Group B

## Why do we need to work on this topic and investigate skin lesions?

Skin lesions are a common health issue that affects millions of people worldwide.  
Skin lesions are areas of your skin that are different from the skin around them.  
Skin lesions detection can help to solve the problem with skin cancer diagnosis.  

In the **"Skin Lesion Extraction And Its Application"** Master thesis of Yanliang Gu at "Michigan Technological University" this problem was explored.  

Yanliang Gu focuses on developing a skin lesion detection algorithm to aid in skin cancer diagnosis.  
The proposed algorithm utilizes color information and thresholding techniques, with an emphasis on evaluating various color spaces to determine optimal performance.  
Experimental results indicate that the YUV color space yields the best detection outcomes.  
Additionally, Gu introduces a distance histogram-based threshold selection method, which outperforms other adaptive thresholding techniques in color detection tasks.  
The thesis also explores GPU acceleration methods to enhance the speed of skin lesion extraction processes, demonstrating the potential for significant performance improvements.  
Building upon these findings, Gu developed a mobile application for skin cancer diagnosis.  
This iPhone-based app allows users to detect potential skin lesions and compare them with a database of known lesions stored on a remote server, thereby facilitating early detection and diagnosis.
