# Project Report on skin lesions: Group B

## Why do we need to work on this topic and investigate skin lesions?

Skin lesions are a common health issue that affects millions of people worldwide.  
Skin lesions are areas of your skin that are different from the skin around them.  
Skin lesions detection can help to solve the problem with skin cancer diagnosis.  

In the **"Skin Lesion Extraction And Its Application"** Master thesis of Yanliang Gu at "Michigan Technological University" this problem was explored.  

Yanliang Gu focuses on developing a skin lesion detection algorithm to aid in skin cancer diagnosis.  
The proposed algorithm utilizes color information and thresholding techniques, with an emphasis on evaluating various color spaces to determine optimal performance.  
Experimental results indicate that the YUV color space yields the best detection outcomes.  
Additionally, Gu introduces a distance histogram-based threshold selection method, which outperforms other adaptive thresholding techniques in color detection tasks.  
The thesis also explores GPU acceleration methods to enhance the speed of skin lesion extraction processes, demonstrating the potential for significant performance improvements.  
Building upon these findings, Gu developed a mobile application for skin cancer diagnosis.

## Data observation

Here we will summarize what we can observe. Amount of pictures annotated by everyone

## Cohen's Kappa method to compare how often annotators agree
Cohen’s Kappa is a statistical measure used to assess the agreement between two annotators while accounting for the possibility of random agreement. Unlike simple percentage agreement, Cohen’s Kappa corrects for agreement that could occur by chance, providing a more accurate reflection of consistency between annotators. The values of Cohen’s Kappa range from -1 to 1, where 1 represents perfect agreement, 0 indicates agreement no better than chance, and negative values suggest systematic disagreement.

We've annotated pictures by marking it from 0 to 2. 0 means there is no hair, 1 - a little bit, 2 - a lof of hair. 

## TELEA method to remove the hair from picture
Explain the TELEA method itself -> then some algorithm - delete this line(comment after)


## Visual results
Here we will insert before, after (4 pictures)


## Conclusion
Conclusion sentences: skin lesions field - why it is a growing field, how can we tackle this, different methods, what we used?
